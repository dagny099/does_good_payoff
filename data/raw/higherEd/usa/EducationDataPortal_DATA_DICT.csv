First-professional degrees may be awarded in the following 10 fields:Chiropractic (DC or DCM)Dentistry (DDS or DMD)Law (LLB, JD)Medicine (MD)Optometry (OD)Osteopathic Medicine (DO)Pharmacy (PharmD)Podiatry (DPM, DP, or PodD)Theology (MDiv, MHL, BD, or Ordination)Veterinary Medicine (DVM).A first-professional certificate was an award that required completion of an organized program of study designed for people who had completed the first-professional degree. Some examples are refresher courses or additional units of study in a specialty or subspecialty.","Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System",""

For example, a 600-hour program with six students enrolled would contribute 3,600 contact hours to the total 12-month activity as long as all 3,600 hours were completed during the time frame. However, if three students completed their program, but the remaining three only completed half the program, the institution should report 1,800 hours for the first three students and 900 hours for the second group, or a total of 2,700 hours toward the 12-month total.","Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System",""
