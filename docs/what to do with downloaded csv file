EXACT STEPS TAKEN TO ACQUIRE DATA:

1. Download csv files from Urban Institute
2. For Institution Data:
-- Create an excel file w/ dataDict sheet and EducationDataPortal data

-- Add 4 columns: atLeast1K_enroll	metCriteria	admission_rate	enrollement_rate
-- For that first column, create a boolean based on whether "number_enrolled_total" >999
-- Calculate admission rate & enrollment rate
-- C&P values, Find&Replace "DIV/0"

-- Create a pivot table with all data in a new sheet (label "criteria")
-- Filters:  
"inst_category" (check 'Degree-granting, primarily baccalaureate or above' OR 'blank')
"atLeast1K_enroll" = 1
-- Rows: unitids
-- Columns: years
-- Values: data of interest, Count of number_enrolled_total
-- Sort by the Grand Total (sum of number of years that univ has data for that measure)

- Use the pivot table to make another little table with these columns to ID which schools meet criteria:
Has 2001	
Has 2002	
Has 2017	
Has at least 6others (btwn 2003-16)
NCriteriaMet

-Ok, the criteria "atLeast1K_enroll" didn't work well -- i think i used the wrong column
-instead, remove schools with a yearly average of num_enrolled_total < 500 

- Delete the rows from universities not in the list to make the file smaller

- Also Find&Replace this in the dataset:
"Suppressed data"
